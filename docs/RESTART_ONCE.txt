⚠️  IMPORTANT: ONE-TIME RESTART NEEDED ⚠️

The auto-reload feature has been added to your code, but you need to 
RESTART THE BOT ONCE to activate it.

After this one restart, you'll NEVER need to restart again when adding pairs!

HOW TO RESTART:

1. Stop the bot: Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running

2. Start it again: ./start.sh

3. Done! Now the auto-reload is active.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER RESTART:

✅ Every 2 minutes, bot checks if config.json was modified
✅ When you add a new pair, bot auto-restarts that worker
✅ New pair starts forwarding immediately
✅ NO MORE MANUAL RESTARTS NEEDED!

Current status:
- Bot is running with OLD code (started 14:56:05)
- Config was modified at 14:58:10
- Bot didn't detect it because old code doesn't have auto-reload
- After restart, NEW code will have auto-reload feature

Just restart ONCE and you're set! 🚀
